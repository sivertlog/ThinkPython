The first goal of this book is to teach you how to program in Python.
But learning to program means learning a new way to think, so the second goal of this book is to help you think like a computer scientist.
This way of thinking combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering, and natural science.
Like mathematicians, computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas â€“ specifically computations.
Like engineers, they design things, assembling components into systems and evaluating trade-offs among alternatives.
Like scientists, they observe the behavior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions.
